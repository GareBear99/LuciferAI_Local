  - Windows: `choco` → `winget`
- Downloads from mirror repository as last resort

**Tier 3: Stub Layer**
- Creates placeholder modules for imports that crash
- Prevents `ImportError` from killing the entire system
- Stubs log calls but return `None` (graceful degradation)

**Tier 4: Emergency CLI**
- Minimal survival shell when everything else fails
- Core commands only: `fix`, `analyze`, `help`, `exit`
- Saves emergency state to `~/.luciferai/logs/emergency/`

**Recovery: System Repair**
- Triggers after 3+ consecutive fallbacks
- 4-step automated recovery:
  1. Rebuild virtual environment
  2. Reinstall missing system tools
  3. Purge broken symbolic links
  4. Verify system integrity
- Returns to Tier 0 on success

## ⚡ Command Routing (LLM vs Local)

LuciferAI intelligently routes commands - **most commands work WITHOUT the LLM**, ensuring speed and offline functionality.

### Commands That Work WITHOUT LLM

These commands are **instant** and work even if no model is installed:

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| **Core** | `help`, `exit`, `quit`, `clear`, `cls`, `mainmenu` |
| **Session** | `session list`, `session info`, `session stats`, `session open <id>` |
| **Models** | `llm list`, `llm enable <model>`, `llm disable <model>`, `models info` |
| **FixNet** | `fixnet sync`, `fixnet stats` |
| **GitHub** | `github status`, `github link`, `github projects` |
| **System** | `environments`, `envs`, `daemon`, `watcher` |
| **Fun** | `badges`, `soul`, `diabolical mode` |
| **Files** | `list <path>`, `read <file>`, `find <pattern>` |
| **Execute** | `run <script>`, `fix <script>` |

### Commands That Use LLM

These require a model but have intelligent fallbacks:

| Type | Example | Fallback Without LLM |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| **Questions** | `what is python?` | Returns "LLM not available" message |
| **Code Generation** | `write a script that...` | Suggests templates or manual creation |
| **Complex Tasks** | `refactor this function` | Provides manual guidance |
| **Natural Language** | `show me all big files` | Falls back to pattern matching |

### Routing Flow

```
User Input
    │
    ├─► Exact match? (help, exit, badges, etc.)
    │     └─► Execute locally (instant) ✅
    │
    ├─► File operation? (list, read, copy, etc.)
    │     └─► Execute with file_tools.py ✅
    │
    ├─► Script command? (run, fix)
    │     └─► Execute with FixNet integration ✅
    │
    ├─► Question? (what, how, why, ?)
    │     └─► Route to LLM (if available)
    │           ├─► LLM available → Stream response
    │           └─► No LLM → Helpful fallback message
    │
    └─► Creation task? (create, write, build)
          └─► Route to LLM with step system
                ├─► LLM available → Multi-step generation
                └─► No LLM → Template suggestions
```

### Auto-Install on First Run

If TinyLlama and llamafile aren't installed, LuciferAI prompts:

```
🔧 LLM Setup Check
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   ● llamafile binary: Not installed
   ● TinyLlama model:  Not installed (670MB)

LuciferAI needs these components for local AI capabilities.
Without them, you can still use LuciferAI but without LLM features.

Install missing components? [Y/n]:
```

- Press **Y** or **Enter**: Downloads and installs (~670MB)
- Press **n**: Continues with local-only commands
