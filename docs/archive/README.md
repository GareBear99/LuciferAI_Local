# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical development documentation that has been archived.

## Why These Docs Are Archived

These documents were created during active development to track implementation progress. Now that features are complete and stable, they have been moved here to:
- Keep the main `/docs` directory focused on current user guides
- Preserve development history for reference
- Maintain a cleaner documentation structure

## What's Archived Here

### Implementation Status Documents
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Completed feature implementations
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Historical status tracking
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Original implementation plans
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Feature summaries
- `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Final status reports
- `IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETE.md` - Completed improvements log
- `DYNAMIC_PARSER_COMPLETE.md` - Parser implementation notes

These documents are **historical snapshots** from development phases and may not reflect current system state.
